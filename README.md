### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Smriti Naik,

Pursuing BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIIT Bhubaneswar. I love to learn and explore new things every day especially, related to technology. Till now, I've mastered all concepts related to frontend development like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and also I have learned SQL. Instead of this, I have recently started doing competitive programming. 

At my free time, I do drawing and dancing. 

Just started doing open sourcing and learning new things from it every day.
